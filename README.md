MNIST Digit Difference with Logistic Regression
- This project trains a Logistic Regression model on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits (0–9).
- It then demonstrates the absolute difference calculation between pairs of predicted digits, such as:
- |5-4| = 1
- |4-5| = 1 
- The model not only predicts the digits but also shows confidence scores (maximum probability and geometric mean probability).

🚀 Features
- Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset (normalization + flattening).
- Trains a Logistic Regression classifier on digit recognition.
- Evaluates model performance with Accuracy and F1-score.
- Visualizes random digit pairs with predicted labels and absolute differences.
- Displays both max confidence and geometric confidence values.

🛠️ Installation
Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:
